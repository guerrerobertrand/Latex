\chapter*{Abstract}

At MobiGIS\footnote{\url{http://www.mobigis.fr/}}, GIS and Transport software publisher and geomatics services company, I joined the Research \& Development \og MobiSAAS \fg project.\\

My internship subject focused on developing web services that exposes functionalities of road and transit data import, for the automatic build of multi-modal transport networks.\\

The purpose of my work was to expose functionalities originally coded in SQL and/or Python languages via a REST API in Java (JAX-RS). I therefore managed the business treatment (Python) and learned to handle data (PostGIS/SQL) via the \og DataWizard \fg project. In the same time, in order to implement these web services I joined the \og MobiSAAS \fg project and thus learned to develop with the \og Dropwizard \fg framework.\\

The developed application of this project is similar to a SAAS\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service}}, the main features of MobiAnalyst Desktop software. It is in the context of the administration interface (backend) that I developed features to upload transit data (GTFS\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/}}). The prospects of my work will be to generalize the utility classes and methods I have developed so that the application may support multiple data formats of transport data (vector data \og Shapefile \fg for example).\\

During this internship I have worked on several projects: MobiSAAS, DataWizard, Crislab, etc. This way, I participated in various phases of software development lifecycle: from the design (R\&D) to development of business code, until the delivery to the customer.
