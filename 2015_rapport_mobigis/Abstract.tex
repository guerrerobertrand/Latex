\chapter*{Abstract}


My internship subject focuses on developing web services that expose the functionality of road and transit data import, for automatic build of multi-modal transport networks. \\

The objective of my work is to expose functionality originally coded in SQL and / or Python via a REST API (JAX-RS). So I initially took over the treatment of warps (ArcPy / Python) and learned to manipulate the data (PostGIS / GTFS) via the project "DataWizard". In parallel, in order to implement these REST web services (Java EE) I joined the project "MobiSaaS" and discovered to develop with the "DropWizard" framework oriented micro-services. \\

The application developed in the project "MobiSaaS" has an administration interface to expose features of MobiAnalyst package \footnote{\url{http://www.mobianalyst.fr/}} like a SaaS. It is in this context that I develop features data upload to the server. So, I realized all my development in a Maven module included in an existing mutli-modules project. My development was carried out mode "concurrency" to support multiple concurrent requests, and make the asynchronous service. Finally as prospects, classes and utilities methods I developed will be generalized so that the "Upload" service supports several other data formats (vector data "Shapefile" for example). \\

During this internship I worked on several projects: DataWizard, Crislab, MobiSaaS, etc ... So I participated in various phases of of software development lifecycle : from the design ( R \ & D), to development of business code, until delivery to the customer. \\
