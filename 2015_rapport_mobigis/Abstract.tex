\chapter*{Abstract}

My internship subject is the development of REST web services to expose functionality to import data about streets and transportation for automatic creation of multi-modal transport networks.\\

The objective of my work is to expose functionality originally coded in SQL and / or Python via a REST API (JAX-RS). To implement the REST web services, I took over the treatments (Python) and data to handle, discovered the micro-service oriented framework "DropWizard" and integrated the "Mobi-Admin" project. I realized all my development in one Maven module included in a mutli-modules Maven project. This project presents an administration interface of many features developed by the enterprise via the licensing and delivery model SaaS. This (Java EE) development was achieved in "concurrent programming" mode (Callable interface) to support multiple simultaneous queries, and to make this service asynchronous. Finally, all classes and utility methods of the service I have developed will be generalized so that the application supports several other data formats (vector data "Shapefile" for example).\\

Finally, during this internship I worked on several projects: DataWizard, Crislab, Moveasy, etc... So I participated in different phases of the life of software development project (from design ( R & D), development of business code, to delivery to the customer.\\
