\chapter*{Abstract}

Within MobiGIS\footnote{\url{http://www.mobigis.fr/}}, publisher of GIS and Transport software and geomatics service company, I joined the Research \& Development "MobiSAAS" project. \\

My internship subject focuses on developing web services that expose functionalities of road and transit data import, for automatic build of multi-modal transport networks. \\

The objective of my work is to expose functionalities originally coded in SQL and/or Python language via a REST API in Java (JAX-RS). So I initially took over the business treatment (Python) and learned to manipulate data (PostGIS/SQL) via the "DataWizard" project. In the same time, in order to implement these web services I joined the "MobiSAAS" project and so learned to develop with the "Dropwizard" framework. \\

The developed application of this project presents like a SAAS the main features of MobiAnalyst Desktop software. It is in the context of the administration interface (backend) I develop features data upload (GTFS) on the server. I thus realized my Java development with Maven. The prospects of my work will be to generalize the utility classes and methods I have developed so that the functionality could support multiple data formats of other transport data format (vector data "Shapefile" for example). \\

During this internship I worked on several projects: MobiSAAS, DataWizard, Crislab, etc ... So I participated in various phases of software development lifecycle : from the design ( R \& D), to development of business code, until delivery to the customer. \\
