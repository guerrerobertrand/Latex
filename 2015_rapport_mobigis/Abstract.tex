\chapter*{Abstract}

My internship subject is the development of REST web services to expose functionality to import data about streets and transportation for automatic creation of multi-modal transport networks.\\

The objective of my work is to expose functionality originally coded in SQL and / or Python via a REST API (JAX-RS). To implement the REST web services, I took over the treatment of warps (Python) and data to handle, discovered the micro-service oriented framework "DropWizard" integrated project "MobiSaas". I realized all my development in a Maven module included in an existing mutli-modules project. The application developed in this project has an administration interface features (MobiAnalyst SaaS). It is in this context that I develop features data upload to the server. My development (Java EE) was achieved by "concurrent programming" mode to support multiple concurrent queries and make the asynchronous service. Finally as prospects, classes and utility methods I developed will be generalized so that the application supports several other data formats (vector data "Shapefile" for example).\\

Finally, during this internship I worked on several projects: DataWizard, Crislab, Moveasy, etc... So I participated in different phases of software development lifecycle (from design ( R\&D), development of business code, to delivery to the customer).\\
